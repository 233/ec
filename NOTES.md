There were various issues with the data released:

1. A lot of the data (particularly for Ashanti, Eastern, and Northern regions) were in Word (.doc/.docx) files. This makes it difficult to write tools to extract data from the source. Luckily most of the data were in properly formatted tables, that could with minor changes be easily copied into Excel to make data extraction easier. The data (from Ashanti particularly) had some crazy tables that took quite a bit of time to cleanup before being extracted into Excel.

2. The Word documents sometimes contained extraneous data, such as a list of "Unwiedly Electoral Areas", summaries, and remarks/propositions to the EC--information that should be in a separate email or document. What this means is, we had to read EVERY document from top to bottom to make sure data contained in documents were relevant before going on to do any extraction.

3. Some of the data was either repeated or incomplete. For instance, the Ahenbronum electoral area in the Ashanti Region had no Designated Centre provided. And data for Brong Ahafo turned out to be data for Volta region with the filename changed. Data for Central region was not available at all. We have a contact at the EC working on this.

4. The data provided did not follow a similar template. We needed to move a few columns around to make data extraction easier. Also a region like Volta had all data in separate spreadsheets within the same Excell workbook/file. All others had them as multiple files (spread across Excel and Word documents). The EC should make it a point to its officers that data collection should NEVER be done in a word processing software like Word. In future, at the minimum, I think a simple template with some basic guidance should be forwarded to district officers for data collection.

5. All Districts have IT officers; they should assist in creating, validating and uploading any such lists in future, if they are not already doing so.
